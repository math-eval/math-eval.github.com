#### Introduction

SVAMP consists of 1000 mathematical word problems, with each problem containing no more than two mathematical expressions and one-unknown variable. The problems have been created with grade level up to 4 by applying simple variations over word problems in an existing dataset like ASDiv-A. 

#### Example

```json
{
    "ID": "chal-2",
    "Body": "Dan had $ 3 left with him after he bought a candy bar. If he had $ 4 at the start",
    "Question": "How much did the candy bar cost?",
    "Equation": "( 4.0 - 3.0 )",
    "Answer": 1.0,
    "Type": "Subtraction"
}
```
