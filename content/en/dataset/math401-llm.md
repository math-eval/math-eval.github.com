#### Introduction

math401-llm includes 401 mathematical computation problems, covering basic arithmetic operations, exponentiation, irrational number operations, trigonometric functions, and logarithmic operations.

math401-llm constructs arithmetic expressions to test large language models which include Euler equa- tion (eiπ + 1 = 0) as group 0 and 25 problems each for group 1∼16. If not otherwise mentioned, used numbers are positive integers.
