#### Introduction

C-eval(Math) consists of five Chinese mathematical multiple-choice question datasets. These datasets cover the subjects of advanced mathematics, discrete mathematics, probability and statistics, high school mathematics, and middle school mathematics. The number of test samples for each dataset is as follows: 173, 153, 166, 270, and 177, respectively.

#### Example

```text
设$f(x)$是定义在$\mathbb{R}$上的奇函数，当$x\leq0$，$f(x)=2x^2-x$，则$f(1)$等于____,-3,-1,1,3
```
