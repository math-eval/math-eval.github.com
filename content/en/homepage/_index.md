  title: Evaluation of LLMs on math
  content: MathEval is a benchmark dedicated to the holistic evaluation on mathematical capacities of LLMs, consisting of 22 evaluation datasets in various mathematical fields and over 70,000 math problems. The aim is to comprehensively evaluate the mathematical problem-solving abilities of LLMs in various grades and difficulties, including arithmetic, primary and secondary school competitions, and some advanced branches of mathematics. MathEval can not only serve as a one-stop reference for horizontal comparison of mathematical abilities among LLMs, but also provides hints and insights on how to further improve the mathematical abilities of LLMs in the future.
